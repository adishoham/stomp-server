This was a school project, and some of the code was given to me.
what i wrote is: the client class, incoder-decode class (encoderDecoderImpl), the protocol class (stompProtocolImpl),
the client data class, connections class (connectionImpl) and the main functions of the server client.
beside those, i was assigned to change the reactor, base server, blocking connection handler and the non-blocking connection handler.
